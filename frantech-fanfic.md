 Francisco is a successful businessman who owns a hosting company called Frantech. His company is doing well and he is respected in the industry. But little does he know, an evil group called "The Glowies" is lurking in the shadows, ready to strike at Frantech.

 The Glowies are a group of mysterious hackers who have been wreaking havoc on the internet, taking down websites and stealing sensitive data. They are led by a ruthless and cunning mastermind known only as The Glower.

 One day, Frantech is attacked by The Glowies, and Francisco is forced to confront the enemy head-on. He quickly realizes that he will need more than just his business savvy to defeat The Glowies and save his company.

 With the help of his loyal employees and some unexpected allies, Francisco begins to gather information on The Glowies and formulate a plan to stop them. But The Glower is always one step ahead, and Francisco must use all of his cunning and determination to outsmart the enemy and save Frantech.

 As the battle between Frantech and The Glowies intensifies, Francisco must confront his own inner demons and overcome his fears in order to emerge victorious. In the end, it will take everything he has to defeat The Glowies and protect his company from their destructive plans.

 As Francisco continues to fight against The Glowies, he realizes that they are not his only enemy. A new threat has emerged in the form of a group of ruthless hackers known as the DDosers. These hackers specialize in launching devastating distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against their targets, bringing down entire networks with just a few clicks of a mouse.

 Frantech is not equipped to handle these attacks on its own, and Francisco knows he needs help. He reaches out to a company called Path.net, which specializes in providing DDoS protection to businesses like Frantech.

 With the help of Path.net, Francisco is able to secure Frantech's network and protect it from the DDosers' attacks. But the fight is far from over, and Francisco must continue to stay one step ahead of his enemies if he wants to keep his company safe.

 As the battle rages on, Francisco learns more about the DDosers and their motivations. He discovers that they are being funded and directed by a shadowy figure known only as "The DDoSer," who is determined to bring Frantech and other companies like it to their knees.

 Determined to put an end to The DDoSer's plans, Francisco and his team at Frantech join forces with Path.net and other allies to launch a counter-attack against the DDosers. In the end, it will take all of their skill and determination to defeat the DDosers and protect Frantech from their destructive plans.

 After months of intense fighting, Francisco and his team at Frantech, along with their allies at Path.net, finally manage to locate and take down the DDosers' massive botnet. The botnet had been responsible for launching devastating DDoS attacks against Frantech and other companies, but with it gone, the DDosers are left powerless.

 With the threat neutralized, Francisco and his team are able to focus on rebuilding and securing Frantech's network. They work tirelessly to repair the damage and implement new security measures to protect against future attacks.

 In the end, Frantech emerges from the battle stronger and more resilient than ever before. The company continues to thrive and grow, thanks in part to the efforts of Francisco and his team, as well as their allies at Path.net.

 Despite the challenges they faced, Francisco and his team never gave up and were able to overcome the odds to save Frantech from the DDosers' attack. They proved themselves to be true heroes, and their story serves as an inspiration to others who are facing their own battles against adversity.

 As Francisco and his team continue to investigate the DDosers, they make a shocking discovery: The Glowies and the DDosers are working together. The two groups have been coordinating their attacks against Frantech and other companies, making it nearly impossible for them to defend themselves.

 The leader of the DDosers, known only as The DDoSer, is enraged when he learns that Francisco has managed to doxx him, revealing his true identity to the world. In retaliation, The DDoSer unleashes a massive DDoS attack against Frantech, hoping to take the company down once and for all.

 But Francisco and his team are ready for the attack this time. With the help of Path.net and their other allies, they are able to repel the DDosers' attack and keep Frantech's network up and running.

 In the end, The DDoSer is forced to flee, and the DDosers are left in disarray. Francisco and his team have successfully thwarted the combined efforts of The Glowies and the DDosers, saving Frantech and bringing peace to the internet once again.

 Despite the success of their previous efforts, Francisco and his team are not out of the woods yet. Unbeknownst to them, several employees at Path.net have been secretly working with the DDosers, providing them with unprotected IP addresses that they can use to launch their attacks.

 When Francisco discovers this betrayal, he is devastated. He thought he could trust the employees at Path.net, but they have let him down. He immediately contacts the owner of the company, who is shocked to learn of the employees' actions.

 The owner of Path.net is a powerful and mysterious figure who has been lurking in the shadows, watching over his company and its employees. When he learns of the betrayal, he is furious and immediately takes action.

 He launches a massive counter-attack against the DDosers, using his incredible technical expertise and access to advanced technology to completely destroy their new botnet. The DDosers are left stunned and powerless, and their plans to bring down Frantech are thwarted once and for all.

 The owner of Path.net reveals himself to Francisco and his team, and they are in awe of his skills and determination. They are grateful for his help, and they know that they could not have saved Frantech without him.

 Together, Francisco, his team, and the owner of Path.net have brought an end to the threat of the DDosers and The Glowies. Frantech is safe, and the internet can once again be a place of freedom and innovation.

 The anime ends with Francisco living the life of his dreams. He is now retired and living on a beautiful paradise island, where he spends his days soaking up the sun and enjoying the crystal-clear waters.

 Despite his retirement, Francisco remains active and engaged with the world. He spends his days chatting with friends and colleagues on Discord, keeping up with the latest developments in the world of technology and business.

 As he sits on the beach, sipping on a cold drink and enjoying the warmth of the sun on his skin, Francisco looks back on his life with a sense of pride and accomplishment. He knows that he has made a difference in the world, and he is grateful for the opportunities he has had and the people he has met along the way.
