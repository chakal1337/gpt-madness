To make the mining code multithreaded and faster, we can use the threading module in Python to create multiple threads that can work on different blocks simultaneously. This can improve the speed of mining by allowing the program to take advantage of multiple CPU cores. Here is an example of how this might be implemented:

```
import hashlib
import threading

# The target is a 256-bit number (extremely difficult to achieve)
target = '0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000'

# The block contains a list of transactions
block = ['my_transaction_1', 'my_transaction_2']

# Create a thread for each CPU core
num_threads = 4
threads = []
for i in range(num_threads):
    thread = threading.Thread(target=mine_block, args=(block, target))
    thread.start()
    threads.append(thread)

# Wait for all threads to complete
for thread in threads:
    thread.join()

def mine_block(block, target):
    # The nonce is a random number that is included in the block
    # It is incremented until a valid block is found
    nonce = 0

    while True:
        # Calculate the SHA-256 hash of the current block
        # including the nonce
        block_hash = hashlib.sha256()
        block_hash.update(str(block).encode('utf-8'))
        block_hash.update(str(nonce).encode('utf-8'))
        block_hash = block_hash.hexdigest()

        # Check if the hash is less than the target
        if block_hash < target:
            print('Valid block found!')
            print('Block hash:', block_hash)
            break

        # Increment the nonce and try again
        nonce += 1
```
This code will create a thread for each CPU core on the system, and each thread will work on mining a block using the provided mine_block function. This should significantly improve the speed of the mining process. However, please note that this is still just a simplified example, and real-world mining programs are much more complex.
